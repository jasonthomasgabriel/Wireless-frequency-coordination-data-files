# audio-technica Wireless Manager

The in- and exclusion data are exclusively nation wide. To fine-tune the exclusion data to your specific region, you will need to select the TV channels that are active on your location. And because of this, regionally there are some allowed and safe frequencies you could add to inclusion data if you need to maximise your possibilities in a difficult location. Please visit RDI's website for this information.

> **Note:** Wireless Manager **does not** seem to prioritise (or snap to) inclusion data, so frequencies may end up being coordinated to a frequency that is neither included nor excluded. This may mean you will operate your wireless device on a frequency that is not allowed by the government.

A way to remedy the above mentioned note is to make a frequency plan and then select the the devices that are coordinated to one of these in/exclusion gaps and assign it an inclusion group closest to where it was coordinated. You then of course need to make a new frequency plan and it is no guarantee this will force another device into a gap.

Another solution is to make a "negative" of all inclusion data and append it to the exclusion data. The reason I have not and will not provide a file like that, is because this is fundamentally incompatible with how the government provides information about what frequencies are allowed to be used.

The best solution is a software update that allows you to assign priority to inclusion data in a similar way WSM does. (Tho, scan data should always win in terms of exclusion).
